well...



Over half a century ago, a device called a "Rolodex" was born. Utilized to store the contact information of an individual or company, this "rolling index" could be found at any work desk.  Because of it's simplicity, well-organized data, and always an arms-length away, the Rolodex remained popular for many years, even into the digital age...

So...

With that in mind, Rolo-Rx was created to easily track, schedule, and organize prescriptions.  All at your fingertips!  Whether you are an individual, a caregiver, or a nurse providing in-home care, Rolo-Rx was designed to help ease the stress of remembering when and how to take medications.
